## Background

Taskify is a simple and intuitive TodoList app developed using Dart and Flutter. The app allows users to efficiently manage their tasks by providing dynamic category management, advanced task tracking, intuitive task management, and persistent data storage. It was developed as a Flutter project, making use of Dart programming language.

The project was initiated to provide users with a user-friendly and feature-rich TodoList app that goes beyond basic functionalities. It incorporates dynamic category management, task prioritization, and the ability to mark tasks as important.

   - Users can easily modify task details and reclassify them by clicking on specific to-do items.

3. **Intuitive Task Management:**
   - A user-friendly interface allows users to mark tasks as completed with a single click.
   - All tasks are displayed in a categorized sidebar for quick navigation.
